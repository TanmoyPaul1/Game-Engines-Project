My game is unique because there is no playable character. 
The corner balls are just decoration. The fish indicates the middle. 

There are 4 arrays of colored balls. Any time there is 3 of a color in an array, it is removed. 
You use the arrow keys to indicate which direction the ball should be shot. 
The ball immediately to the right/left/top/bottom of the middle ball is pushed up to be replaced.
The replacement works by pushing into the array at that middle point. 
The array on top goes from left to right, the bottom is vice versa. 
The array on the left goes from top to bottom, the right is vice versa. 
The game ends when all the arrays are too short to reach or 50 color matches have been made.

I used an Array class to store Units and added the necessary functions instead of using 
a vector because it was easier to draw them this way and customize other functions. 
The Shoot method is used in the OnKeyPress function instead of with OnUpdate so that only
keyboard presses can activate its functionality. I edited the Unit implementation to suit 
the balls instead of a character. I overloaded an operator to compare Units.
